# FMCS

This is the Flavors Meta-Class System (FMCS) for Demonic Metaprogramming in Common Lisp, an alternative to CLOS+MOP. It has been restored from the CMU AI Repository, alongside Jürgen Walther's BABYLON framework for knowledge engineering and expert systems, from which the sources were extracted.

## TODO

- [x] Extract FMCS from BABYLON
- [ ] Clean up original source-code
- [ ] Restore the original documentation
- [ ] Integrate with BAPHOMET
- [ ] Compile to Hyperlattices
