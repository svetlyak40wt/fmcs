# FMCS

This is the Flavors Meta-Class System (FMCS) for _Demonic Metaprogramming_ in Common Lisp, an alternative to CLOS+MOP. It has been restored from the CMU AI Repository[^1], alongside J端rgen Walther's [BABYLON][] AI Workbench system, from which the sources were extracted.

[^1]: The CMU AI Repository was a collection of AI software, data, and documentation maintained by Carnegie Mellon University, and hosted on CSNET/ARPANET from 1985&ndash;1992. It was the first public repository of its kind, and was the primary source of AI software for the Lisp Machine and broader AI communities during the 1980s and early 1990s. The CMU AI Repository was maintained as an archive available online from CMU's Computer Science department until recently, and is now being painstakingly restored by ["the Phoeron" Colin J.E. Lupton][@thephoeron].

## TODO

The following tasks are required to complete the restoration of FMCS:

- [x] Extract FMCS from BABYLON
- [x] Clean up original source-code
- [ ] Restore and update original documentation
- [ ] Generate API Documentation in Markdown format
- [ ] Generate unit tests

While the following tasks are to support extended features:

- [ ] Integrate with [BAPHOMET][]
- [ ] Replace hand-coded STANDARD-CLASS object with Hyperlattice implementation
- [ ] Rewrite low-level definitions as Hyperlattice operations

## Demonic Metaprogramming

TODO: give a brief overview of Demonic Metaprogramming, and how it differs from the MOP, covering the following topics:

- Modelling software by Control Flow and Data Flow
- SSA-Form and Phi-Functions as Nondeterminstic Choice
- Angelic and Demonic Semantics of Nondeterministic Choice
- Favoring Demonic Semantics for Metaprogramming
- Demonic Nondeterminism over Unified Control/Data Flow Graph
- Demon Methods versus Generic Functions
- The Flavors System versus CLOS
- The Flavors Meta-Class System (FMCS) versus the MOP
- Demonic Semantics of Backquote Syntax in Macroexpansion

## SBCL Users

For SBCL, FMCS relies on `FARE-QUASIQUOTE` to macroexpand backquote syntax in keeping with idiomatic conventions followed by all other Common Lisp implementations.

When using FMCS for your own projects, you will need to conditionally depend on `FARE-QUASIQUOTE-EXTRAS` for SBCL in your ASDF systems, and use its named-readtable in every source-file where FMCS forms are used to ensure correct macroexpansion at every level.

For example, in your ASDF system definition:

```lisp
(defsystem my-project
  ...
  :depends-on ((:feature :sbcl fare-quasiquote-extras)
               fmcs)
  :components ((:file "package")
               (:file "my-project")))
```

And in your source-files:

```lisp
(in-package :my-project)

#+sbcl
(named-readtables:in-readtable :fare-quasiquote)

...

#+sbcl
(named-readtables:in-readtable :standard)

;; eof
```

Alternatively, as the documentation for `FARE-QUASIQUOTE` suggests, you can use ASDF's `:around-compile` hook to automatically wrap all source-files in the appropriate `NAMED-READTABLES:IN-READTABLE` forms.
