# FMCS

This is the Flavors Meta-Class System (FMCS) for Common Lisp, an alternative to CLOS+MOP. It has been restored from the CMU AI Repository, alongside JÃ¼rgen Walther's BABYLON framework for knowledge engineering and expert systems, from which it was extracted.

## TODO

- [ ] Restore the original documentation
- [ ] Integrate with BAPHOMET
- [ ] Compile to Hyperlattices
